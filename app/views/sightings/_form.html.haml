    Before you submit, make sure you know:
    
      * Tarla sightings only last for about ten minutes or fewer. **If this
        finding is from an hour ago, please don't submit it!** Thanks!
      * We depend on the community for helping us keep this site accurate, and
        the community has its less honest folk. Other users will be keeping track
        of whether or not your submission is accurate, and **we will ban users
        found to abuse the Tour Tracker.** Thanks in advance for keeping this an
        excellent resource!
