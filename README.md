Tarla's Tour Tracker
====================

This is a web application written in Rails 3 (3.0.0.beta2), to help users keep
track of Neopets.com's character Tarla as she heads out on her [Tour of
Mystery][1].

Feel free to poke around! If you'd like to get to know how the application
flows, I'd start in `app/controllers/`. To get to know how sightings and votes
themselves work, check out `app/models/`. To get to know how everything gets
rendered into a nice HTML template, take a look at `app/views/`. (We use HAML
for the views, so the syntax may look strange - but it makes the views much,
much easier to produce!)

Got something to contribute? Fork the project, make your change, and let us
know! We love getting help from everyone we can :)
